This is a project for Introduction to Database Systems(COMP130010.01)@ Fudan University, a web game for pet cat raising.

In this game, you can buy food from the market and feed the stray cats in park. To some point, the cat may beg you to adopt it and give it a lovely name, and surely you can also turn it down. 

### Hint

- You can make money by reselling the food in the markets, since the prices may fluctuate and then you can make big profits or lose your shirt. it's just like stocks, isn't it?

- You may find that the cat has different status: 

  - A LITTLE HUNGRY
  - PRETTY HUNGRY NOW!
  - STARVING TO DEATH!

  The cat will become hungrier with the passage of time, and if your pet cat is "STARVING TO DEATH!", it may run away from home. So you should think carefully about your raising, since you budget is limited. A good news is the hungrier the cat is, the better effect your feeding will achieve.

Hope you have fun with it
